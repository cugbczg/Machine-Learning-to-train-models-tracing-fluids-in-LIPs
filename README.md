# Machine-Learning-to-train-models-tracing-fluids-in-LIPs
Random forest (RF), deep neural network (DNN) and support vector machines (SVM) are employed trace the role of fluids in the generation of the early Permian Tarim large igneous province (LIP) in northwestern China. Training data were extracted from the GEOROC (http://georoc.mpch-mainz.gwdg.de/georoc/) and PetDB (https://search.earthchem.org/) databases involving global island-arc basalts (IAB), mid-oceanic ridge basalts (MORB) and OIB to establish the predictive models. Firstly, train models using 10194 basalt samples, comprising 3277 IAB samples, 5920 OIB samples, and 997 MORB samples. Secondly, basaltic samples were tested to yield the prediction results.
